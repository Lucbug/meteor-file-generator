# Meteor File Generator
Automatically create meteor files. This package will help you generate starting files for your templates by creating both HTML and JS files with the name of the template you want.

  ## How it works
  Open atom and `ctrl-n ctrl-m` to open the dialog box, then type in the name of the template you want to create. 2 files will be created where you opened your last file.

  ## Todo
- [ ] Better file destination
- [ ] Better opening and closing of modal
- [ ] File templates (both HTML and JS)
- [ ] Automatically add the new template to the route.js
